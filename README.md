This file is responsible for launching the `index.html` file in your browser from Visual Studio Code. My preferences are set to launch the Firefox browser <3 but if you want to change it, it's pretty easy! Just edit the [`launch.json`](https://github.com/SpyderGamer/Javascript-Kickstarter/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json) file:
<br/>

- For Firefox (You need the Firefox debugging extension `firefox-devtools.vscode-firefox-debug`:
```
"type": "firefox",
```

- For Chrome:
```
"type": "chrome",
```

- For MS Edge:
```
"type": "edge",
```
It's that easy!
